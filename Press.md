# Press Kit

Information for the Press/Media is detailed in this page; as well as in a downloadable [PDF](#). Kindly go throught it before getting in touch with us.

## Overview
We are a group of students and alumni from the NMIMS University. Robotics enthusiasts at heart, we were given the generous opportunity from Satellize and ISRO and we have been selected to launch our payload into Low Earth Orbit. We are taking this opportunity to test the properties of a Smart Material called Terfenol - D in orbit and assessing its potential to create advanced payloads as Commercial-off-the-shelf modules.

### About the Project
The payload is a test-bed containing the Terfenol-D sample strapped with strain gauges. The alloy is energized by a solenoid wrapped around a iron core to create a magnetic field. The magnetic fields cause a change in the dimensions of the alloy. This opens up a plethora of possibilities for payloads with lighter weight and compact designs. 

The payload will be launched from the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle of the Indian Space Research Organization and communicated from the Satellize Spaceshare module.

### Unique Points
>Modular test bed design allows for testing of multiple properties of any magnetostrictive materials
>Terfenol D boasts one of the highest strain values of 0.002 m/m at saturation
