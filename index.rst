NMIMS in Space
========================================

**NMIMS in Space** is a research project started by an interdisciplinary team of students & alumni from NMIMS MPSTME. Most of us are aspiring researchers who are looking forward to creating our own mark in the research & academia world & are humbled to have accepted this opportunity by Satellize & ISRO.

The **NRT-1** or **NMIMS Robotics Testbed-1** is our foray into desiging and building space-grade robotic components.
