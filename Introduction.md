# Introduction

**NMIMS in Space** is a research project started by an interdisciplinary team of students & alumni from NMIMS MPSTME. Most of us are aspiring researchers who are looking forward to creating our own mark in the research & academia world & are humbled to have accepted this opportunity by Satellize & ISRO.

Our experiment consists of a Test-Bed apparatus using a space-grade PCB that contains a sample of Terfenol-D, a magnetostrictive alloy of Terbium, Dysprosium and Iron. The alloy is attached to strain gauges and actuated with magnetic field generated by a current-carrying solenoid. The testbed will send us data of the response of terfenol-D to magnetic fields and other stimuli in space. It would show that Terfenol-D and other Magnetostrictive alloys can be used in space-grade components in the form of sensors, actuators as well as structural components.

It all started (with a big bang) from Saksham's love for diarrhetic, spicy & bloating pseudo-Chinese food over at Chhotu's.
